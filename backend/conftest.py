    Must set `settings.STORAGES`, not the legacy `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` —
    Django 5.1 removed the compatibility shim that used to translate the
    latter into the former, so setting only `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` here is a
    silent no-op and `django.core.files.storage.default_storage` keeps
    reading whatever `STORAGES["default"]["BACKEND"]` already says (see
    Phase 11's notes in IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md — this exact mistake shipped
    once already, briefly making real Cloudinary calls from test runs).
