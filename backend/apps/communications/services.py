    Every branch filters by `announcement.school` explicitly — targeting
    must remain tenant-scoped no matter how it's sliced (spec's explicit
    requirement). Uses `unscoped_objects` throughout (with that explicit
    school filter as the real scoping), not `objects`, since this can be
    called from a request-scoped view *or* directly (tests, future
    management commands) — see the Phase 9/10 "outside request context"
    rule: `objects` on a TenantScopedModel silently returns nothing without
    ambient tenant context, so relying on it here would work in the view
    and quietly break everywhere else.
