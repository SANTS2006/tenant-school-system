class SummaryStatsMixin:
    """
    Opt-in summary-stats endpoint for any ViewSet — declare a `summary_stats` dict, get a
    `GET .../summary/` action for free. Each entry is either a plain filter-kwargs dict (counted
    as-is) or `{"groupby": "<field>"}` (counted per distinct value of that field), e.g.:

        summary_stats = {
            "total": {},
            "active": {"is_active": True},
            "upcoming": {"start_datetime__gte": timezone.now},  # callables resolved per-request
            "by_status": {"groupby": "status"},
        }

    Deliberately declarative (a dict, not a method to override) so adding this to an existing
    ViewSet is a one-line addition, not a rewrite. Reuses `filter_queryset(get_queryset())` — the
    same search/filter params the caller already applied to the list also shape the summary, so a
    filtered list's stat row reflects the filter rather than the whole table. Permission: reuses
    whatever the ViewSet's own `get_permissions()` already does for an action it doesn't
    recognize — every ViewSet in this codebase defaults an unlisted action to its `view` code, so
    `summary` is covered automatically, no new permission codes needed anywhere.

    `school` is deliberately never a client-settable serializer field on any

    the default `create()` has nothing to populate it with. This override
    sets it from the request's tenant context on every create, centrally,
    so every subclass gets it for free rather than each domain app needing
    to remember its own `perform_create()`.

    Deliberately reads `get_current_school_id()` (the same tenant context
    `TenantManager` scopes reads by) rather than `self.request.user.school`
    directly — for a normal school user these are always the same value,
    but a platform admin has no `.school` of their own at all, so reading
    it directly would break creates while a platform admin is "viewing" a
    school's data (see apps.tenants.mixins.ACTING_SCHOOL_HEADER) even
    though reads work correctly for that same case.

    A viewset with its own bespoke `create()` (e.g. one that also emails an
    invitation, like `SchoolViewSet`) doesn't call `perform_create()` at
    all, so this has no effect there.
