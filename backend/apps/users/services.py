    Every invited account — platform admin or school user — is active immediately with a
    deterministic default password (a school's, or the shared platform-admin one; see
    apps.tenants.services), flagged `must_change_password`, and emailed those sign-in details.
    The password is knowable/reproducible by design rather than random: an administrator can
    reset any of their users back to this same value later (see the `reset_password` actions on
    Staff/Parent/PlatformAdmin), which only makes sense if the value doesn't move around, and
    it's already knowable to whoever created the account, so putting it in one first email isn't
    disclosing anything new.
