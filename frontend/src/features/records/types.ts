/** Named `SchoolRecord`, not `Record` — the latter shadows TypeScript's built-in `Record<K, V>`
 * utility type, which other files in this codebase use.
 *
 * `created_by`/`created_by_name` are server-computed from `request.user` on create, never
 * client-writable. `file` is a plain Django `FileField` — write as multipart/form-data when a
 * new file is picked, read back as a media URL string. Either `body` or `file` (or both) must be
 * present — enforced both client- and server-side. */
